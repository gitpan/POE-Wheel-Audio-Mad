Revision history for Perl extension POE::Wheel::Audio::Mad.

0.3  Wed Oct 22 03:27:15 2003
	- final tweaks,  getting ready for something release 
	  quality.  more work was done to make sure everything
	  interoperates smoothly.
	  
	- several documentation tweaks to fix outright lies
	  about decoder behaviour and interface.  also added
	  a bit more information in on what messages mean.

0.2  Sat Oct 18 09:45:02 2003
	- updated a good portion of the decoders internal structure,
	  and also made it more friendly to having a user-specified
	  alias.  the dual module/session issue was fixed by
	  completely taking advantage of a wheel's nature.  originally,
	  this was written as a component,  and I find this new 
	  design to be infinitely more flixible and intuitive.  yay.
	  
	- much documentation added..  most of the options,  messages,
	  and states were documented.

0.1  Tue Oct 14 23:54:56 2003
	- added in some pod to help people along with the module.  the
	  module strucutre really isn't clear,  as there's always two
	  modules and two sessions being initalized..  make it clearer,
	  or subclass,  or something..
	  
	- documented all code in this package as best I could,  there
	  are problems yet to be fixed,  and this module is really
	  only suited to x86 platforms where Audio::OSS is available.
	  all audio is played with AFMT_S16_LE.

	- transformed the modules to fit inside a new namespace..
	  POE::Wheel::Audio::Mad
	  
	- most of the code here was taken from another project I had
	  written to create yet another curses mpeg player (but I
	  wrote mine in perl,  nyah..)

	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-A -X -n POE::Wheel::Audio::Mad
